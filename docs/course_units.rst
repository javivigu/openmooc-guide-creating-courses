***********************
Course, units and pills
***********************

OpenMOOC have three levels for contents: course, units and pills.

======
Course
======
A **course** consists of:

* General information on the course, teachers.
* The units that form.

====
Unit
====
A **unit** consist of pills and there are three types of units:

* Normal, to expose the contents and usually published weekly.
* Homework, to promote the individual and groupal work, usually
  published weekly and related with the contents exposed in the normal unit of that week.
* Exam, to measure the assimilation of content by students.

Homework and exam are limited in time, with a start and end time.

====
Pill
====
A **pill** consist of:

* One online video from Youtube or Vimeo (or prezi or scribd content) like central content.
* Comments by the teacher to clarify some thing exposed in the video.
* Additional material to extend the content exposed in the video.
* Some file attached.

You can add forms or peer review tasks to a pill.

.. note:: The optimal use is adding some questions to normal units (not in all the pills) and
   not use peer review. It's better the use of peer review in homework units.
