Course, units and pills
***********************

OpenMOOC have three levels for contents: course, units and pills.

======
Course
======
A **course** consists of:

* General information on the course, teachers.
* The units that form.

====
Unit
====
A **unit** consist of pills and there are three types of units:

* Normal, to expose the contents and usually published weekly.
* Homework, to promote the individual and groupal work, usually
  published weekly and related with the contents exposed in the normal unit of that week.
* Exam, to measure the assimilation of content by students.

Homework and exam are limited in time, with a start and end time.

====
Pill
====
A **pill** (or nugget) consist of:

* One online video from Youtube or Vimeo (or prezi or scribd content) like central content.
* Comments by the teacher to clarify some thing exposed in the video.
* Additional material to extend the content exposed in the video.
* Some file attached.

You can add forms or peer review tasks to a pill.

.. note:: The optimal use is adding some questions to normal units (not in all the pills) and
   not use peer review. It's better the use of peer review in homework units.

When you know the three levels of content with which OpenMOOC works, you can create the course structure.
